🧬 Structured Clinical Data – GPT Framework


📘 Project Overview

This project explores how Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) can be applied to structured clinical and biomedical data for predictive analysis, data imputation, and synthetic data generation.
The goal is to develop a digital twin model for patients, focusing on lung disease–related data, to simulate and predict health outcomes.

🎯 Objectives

Adapt existing GPT/LLM frameworks to process structured numeric biomedical data

Prepare and integrate time-series clinical data from multiple patient visits

Train and evaluate models for disease prediction and missing data imputation

Generate synthetic patient data for research and analysis

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

PyTorch / TensorFlow

Transformers (Hugging Face)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
